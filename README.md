# ctrace
Well-formatted and improved trace system calls and signals (when the debugger does not help).

## Why?
Awesome tools ```strace``` and ```dtruss``` have only one drawback: too much information which is hard to understand without additional sources of information and various configuration options. ```ctrace``` resolves it.

```ctrace``` are indispensable in the following cases
   - Debugging complex performance issues or not identified unhandled errors and exceptions in own code or someone else's code
   - Learning OS kernel


## Features

- Supported platforms: OSx (dtruss), Linux (strace)
- Trace command or attach to process (with forks following)
- Syscall details in output (number, description, synonyms, is it platform specific syscall) <br> ``` pread (preadv), 534 -- read or write data into multiple ```
- Resolving errno in syscall result <br> ```Err#22 -> EINVAL : Invalid argument``` (only OSx)
- Prints by default only syscall with errors, with ```-v``` prints all output
- Filter output with syscall list ``` -f "lstat,open" ```

## Installation
```sh
$> npm install -g ctrace
```

```
$> ctrace --help

Usage: ctrace [options]

 ctrace - well-formatted and improved trace system calls and signals

 Options:

   -h, --help               output usage information
   -V, --version            output the version number
   -p, --pid [pid]          process id to trace
   -c, --cmd [cmd]          command to trace
   -f, --filter [syscall,]  trace syscall only from list
   -v, --verbose            print all syscalls (by default only with errors)

 Examples:

   $ ctrace -p 2312 -v
   $ ctrace -c "ping google.com"
```

## Troubleshooting

### OSx : Dtrace cannot control executables signed with restricted entitlements

As you may know Apple released their new OS X revision 10.11 this year with a great security feature built-in: System Integrity Protection. In a nutshell, this mechanism protects any system data and important filesystem components (like /System or /usr) from being modified by user; even if they are root. SIP also disables any use of code-injection and debugging techniques for third-party software, so some of your favorite hacks may not work anymore.
...

#### Completely disable SIP

Although not recommended by Apple, you can entirely disable System Integrity Protection on you Mac. Here's how:

Boot your Mac into Recovery Mode: reboot it and hold cmd+R until a progress bar appears.
Choose the language and go to Utilities menu. Choose Terminal there.
Enter this command to disable System Integrity Protection:
```
$> csrutil disable
```
It will ask you to reboot â€” do so and you're free from SIP!
